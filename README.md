# tl;dr

OpenInddor app aims to render OSM data inside a building in a 3D way.

It massively relies on https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Simple_Indoor_Tagging

3 rendering modes:

* building
* floors
* indoor (data from a floor between level L to L+1)

# Cartographers / developers

You can drag and drop your geojson file into the web map (from JOSM or any similar tool).

It allows you to check 3D rendering before releasing your work in OSM, or not if you want to keep your data private.

Have a look at [here](EXAMPLES.md) to get examples.
